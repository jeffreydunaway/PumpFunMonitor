# PumpFunMonitor Bot: First Principles & SCAMPER Analysis

## 1. First Principles Analysis

First Principles thinking breaks things down to their most fundamental truths and reasons up from there.

### What are the Fundamentals Here?

- **Goal:** Automatically discover, filter, and alert on new PumpFun coins according to your custom criteria.
- **Core Building Blocks:**
  - **Data Acquisition:** Get new coin info from PumpFun API.
  - **Filtering:** Only care about coins meeting your standards (liquidity, fee, holders, etc).
  - **Persistence:** Log results in a database (SQLite).
  - **Alerting:** Notify you (and others) on Telegram when something interesting happens.
  - **Repeat:** Do this on a fixed schedule.

### Why These Choices?

- **web3.js:** To interact with Ethereum easily in JavaScript/Node.js.
- **axios:** For simple HTTP requests (to PumpFun API).
- **sqlite3:** Lightweight, zero-config, and fast local database.
- **node-telegram-bot-api:** Easiest way to push messages to Telegram.
- **Environment variables:** Secure, configurable, and easy to change for deployment.

### How Does It Work?

- Loads settings from `.env` (API keys, thresholds, Telegram info).
- On startup, sets up the database schema if needed.
- Every POLL_INTERVAL seconds:
  1. Fetches the latest coins from PumpFun.
  2. Parses and checks each coin:
      - Meets your minimum quality bar? (liquidity, fee, holders, age)
      - Creator or coin is blacklisted? (including “too many coins” per creator)
  3. If it passes, saves the coin and sends a Telegram alert.
- All logic is modular and clear—each function does one thing.

## 2. SCAMPER Method for Creative Analysis

SCAMPER stands for **Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse**. It’s a method to brainstorm improvements or variations.

### S - Substitute

- **Data Source:** Swap out PumpFun for another launchpad API by changing the endpoint and data parsing.
- **Database:** Use MongoDB or Postgres instead of SQLite.
- **Notifications:** Use Discord, email, or SMS instead of Telegram.

### C - Combine

- **With Trading Bots:** After filtering, trigger an auto-buy.
- **On-chain Analytics:** Add wallet reputation APIs for deeper filtering.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate Twitter, Reddit, or news feeds.

### A - Adapt

- **Other Chains:** Use BSC, Solana, etc., by changing provider/APIs.
- **Filter Logic:** Update filtering as new scam patterns or market trends appear.

### M - Modify (Magnify/Minimize)

- **Magnify:** Increase polling frequency, add more data fields, or use advanced ML filters.
- **Minimize:** Strip out features for speed or simplicity.

### P - Put to Another Use

- Monitor NFT launches, airdrops, or other DeFi events.
- Use the framework for anything API+filter+alert (e.g., web monitoring).

### E - Eliminate

- Remove the database for real-time-only alerts.
- Remove Telegram if you prefer another notification channel.

### R - Reverse

- Track/remediate bad actors or scam coins rather than just finding good ones.
- Reverse the filter: alert on coins that fail criteria for research.

## 3. Self-Efficacy—How Can You Own and Extend This?

### Understand Each Module

- **Config:** All thresholds and keys are in one place—change and observe effects.
- **Database:** Open `pumpfun.db` with any SQLite client (e.g., `sqlitebrowser`).
- **API:** View the raw PumpFun API with a browser or Postman.
- **Filter Logic:** Tweak thresholds or add new rules directly in `applyFilters()`.

### Experiment

- Change `POLL_INTERVAL` for speed.
- Add new fields and capture more info.
- Add new notifications (e.g., Discord) by copying the Telegram logic.

### Debug and Log

- Use `console.log` to inspect raw data and logic.
- Use try/catch for robust experimentation.

### Learn by Doing

- Clone, run, break, and fix the code.
- Start simple, then add features you wish it had.
