# PumpFunMonitor
//PumpFunExplained

This document explains the structure and purpose of the `__init__.py` file found in the NumPy package. This file is executed when you import NumPy and is responsible for setting up the package, exposing its API, and performing various checks and configurations.

---

## 1. Module Docstring

The top of the file contains a comprehensive docstring that:
- Describes what NumPy provides (arrays, fast math, linear algebra, etc.).
- Explains how to use the documentation and IPython for exploring NumPy.
- Lists available subpackages and utilities.
- Explains the difference between copies and in-place operations.

---

## 2. Imports and Globals

- **Standard Library Imports:**  
  `os`, `sys`, `warnings` for environment and warning management.
- **Internal Imports:**  
  Imports internal NumPy modules and version info.
- **Globals:**  
  Imports `_NoValue`, `_CopyMode`, and `__expired_attributes__` for internal use.

---

## 3. Version Handling

- Imports the version string from the internal `version` module.

---

## 4. Setup Detection

- Checks if NumPy is being imported as part of its own build process (`__NUMPY_SETUP__`).  
  If so, it avoids importing submodules that may not be built yet.

---

## 5. Distributor Customization

- Allows Linux distributions or other vendors to run custom initialization code before importing NumPy's core.

---

## 6. Core Imports and API Exposure

- **Imports the Core:**  
  Imports the main C-accelerated core (`numpy._core`) and exposes a huge list of functions, types, and constants at the top level.
- **Handles Deprecated Aliases:**  
  Tries to import deprecated types (like `float96`) if available.
- **Imports Submodules:**  
  Imports submodules like `lib`, `matrixlib`, and their key functions.
- **Defines `__all__`:**  
  Lists all public symbols that should be available when using `from numpy import *`.

---

## 7. Submodule and Attribute Management

- **Lazily Loads Submodules:**  
  Implements `__getattr__` to import submodules only when accessed.
- **Handles Deprecated and Removed Attributes:**  
  Raises informative errors or warnings for deprecated or removed attributes.
- **Custom `__dir__`:**  
  Customizes the list of attributes shown by `dir(np)`.

---

## 8. Testing Utilities

- **Pytest Integration:**  
  Provides a `test` function for running NumPy's test suite.

---

## 9. Sanity Checks

- **General Sanity Check:**  
  Verifies that basic operations (like dot product) work, catching common misconfigurations (e.g., BLAS issues).
- **Mac OS Accelerate Check:**  
  Checks for known bugs in Mac OS's Accelerate framework.

---

## 10. Hugepage Setup (Linux Optimization)

- **Memory Optimization:**  
  Enables hugepage support on Linux for better memory performance, unless the kernel is too old or the feature is disabled.

---

## 11. Reload and Sub-interpreter Guard

- **Reload Guard:**  
  Warns if NumPy is reloaded or imported in a sub-interpreter, which can cause issues.

---

## 12. Environment Variable Handling

- **Promotion State Warning:**  
  Warns if a deprecated environment variable (`NPY_PROMOTION_STATE`) is set.

---

## 13. PyInstaller Support

- **Hook Directory:**  
  Provides a function to help PyInstaller find NumPy's hooks for packaging.

---

## 14. Cleanup

- **Namespace Cleanup:**  
  Deletes internal-use symbols from the module namespace to avoid polluting the public API.
